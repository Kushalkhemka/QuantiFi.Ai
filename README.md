# QuantiFi.Ai - Agentic AI Fraud Detection System

## Overview
The **Agentic AI Fraud Detection System** is a cutting-edge, modular, and adaptive fraud detection platform powered by a multi-agent architecture. Leveraging specialized agents, this system provides real-time, scalable fraud detection across various industries, including banking, e-commerce, healthcare, and insurance. The platform dynamically adapts to evolving fraud patterns, reduces false positives, and offers explainable decision-making for compliance and audit purposes.

## Key Features
- **Modular Agent Pipeline:** The system uses a set of specialized agents, each focused on distinct fraud detection tasks like pattern recognition, behavioral profiling, risk synthesis, and decision-making.
- **Real-Time Fraud Detection:** Analyze high-volume transaction streams in real-time, flagging suspicious behavior and fraud attempts with low latency.
- **Explainable AI:** Provides clear, interpretable fraud decisions and justifications, meeting regulatory requirements and audit standards.
- **Adaptivity:** Continuously learns and adapts to emerging fraud trends, ensuring resilience against evolving fraud techniques.
- **Multi-Industry Use Cases:** Applicable across banking, e-commerce, healthcare, and insurance sectors.

## Use Cases
1. **Banking & Financial Services**  
   Detect account takeovers, synthetic identity fraud, and money laundering by analyzing transaction patterns, device behavior, and velocity. Automatically file regulatory reports (SAR, CTR, KYC) and manage fraud risk.

2. **E-Commerce & Digital Marketplaces**  
   Monitor online transactions for payment fraud, fake accounts, and bot attacks. Detect phishing and social engineering scams via multi-channel analysis.

3. **Healthcare & Insurance**  
   Identify fraudulent claims, billing inconsistencies, and fake identities by analyzing claims data and behavior patterns.

4. **Fraud Investigation & Compliance**  
   Streamline regulatory compliance, automate fraud detection, and ensure privacy-preserving fraud investigations with federated learning and compliance officers' agents.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI,  TensorFlow, PyTorch (for ML models), sentence-transformers, OPENAI
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Database:** ChromaDB
- **ML & AI Frameworks:** CrewAI, LangGraph , Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Transformers (for NLP), Graph Neural Networks (for synthetic identity detection)
- **Deployment:**  Streamlit

## Agents
1. **Contextual Feature Extractor** – Extracts and enriches transactional data with relevant contextual signals.
2. **Pattern Divergence Analyst** – Analyzes deviations in user behavior and flags unusual patterns.
3. **Risk Synthesizer** – Combines agent outputs and external risk signals to synthesize fraud risk.
4. **Explanation Generator** – Generates human-readable justifications for fraud risk decisions.
5. **Decision Recommender** – Makes final fraud detection decisions based on the synthesized risk.
6. **Feedback Integration Loop** – Continuously refines agent performance using feedback from analysts.
